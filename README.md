This is a program that uses the hundt or sainte lague method.
It is meant to be used in the TI-NSPIRE.
Also there is a custom quocient mode
To use just press Ctrl+r and select mode, setup and then you can run the estimation.
Next version:
Adding a dumb proof to the input methods so the program doesnt exit when the wrong type of variable is inputed to the wrong place.
